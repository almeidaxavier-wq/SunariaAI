Methods: A total of 411 multiple-choice questions, with and without images, were analyzed, organized into four main themes: chronic kidney disease (CKD), hydroelectrolytic and acid-base disorders (HABD), tubulointerstitial diseases (TID), and glomerular diseases (GD). Questions with images were answered only by ChatGPT-4. Statistical analysis was performed using the chi-square test.  Results: ChatGPT-4 achieved an overall accuracy of 79.80%, while ChatGPT-3.5 achieved 56.29%, with a statistically significant difference (p < 0.001). In the main themes, ChatGPT-4 performed better in HABD (79.11% vs. 55.17%), TID (88.23% vs. 52.23%), CKD (75.51% vs. 61.95%), and DG (79.31% vs. 55.29%), all with p < 0.001. ChatGPT-4 presented an accuracy of 81.49% in questions without images and 54.54% in questions with images, with an accuracy of 60% for electrocardiogram analysis. This study is limited by the small number of image-based questions and the use of outdated examination items, reducing its ability to assess visual diagnostic skills and current clinical relevance. Furthermore, addressing only 4 areas of Nephrology may not fully represent the breadth of nephrology practice.  Conclusion: ChatGPT-3.5 was found to have limitations in nephrology reasoning compared to ChatGPT-4, evidencing gaps in knowledge. The study suggests that further exploration is needed in other nephrology themes to improve the use of these AI tools.", "urls": ["http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0101-28002025000400302&lang=pt"], "file_attachments1": "http://www.scielo.br/pdf/jbn/v47n4/2175-8239-jbn-47-4-e20240254.pdf", "keywords": ["Generative Artificial Intelligence", "Large Language Models", "Medical Residency Exam", "Nephrology", "Intelig\u00eancia Artificial Generativa", "Modelos de Linguagem de Grande Escala", "Exame de Resid\u00eancia M\u00e9dica", "Nefrologia"]}, {"type_of_reference": "JOUR", "authors": ["Weglarz, Dominika", "Pla-Garcia, Cintia", "Jim\u00e9nez-Zarco, Ana Isabel"], "title": "Aceptaci\u00f3n de la Inteligencia Artificial Generativa en la industria creativa: el rol del modelo UTAUT, reconocimiento y la confianza de marca en su adopci\u00f3n", "translated_title": "Acceptance of Generative AI in the creative industry: the role of UTAUT, brand recognition and trust in adoption", "journal_name": "RETOS.

In order to obtain the results, the PRISMA methodology is applied, which allows us to respond to the stated objective. A systematic review of 35 in-depth studies from 2018-2024 was carried out. The results obtained show that AI has optimised processes in Ecuador, such as predictive investigation, as well as judicial automation, achieving a 30% reduction in case assignment times. However, critical challenges were identified, such as the replication of algorithmic biases (e.g. over-imputation of indigenous groups) and normative gaps in the regulation of the evidentiary validity of AI. The methodology also made it possible to contrast international experiences with the local reality, revealing a gap in Ecuadorian empirical studies. Ecuador still lacks quality standards and independent audits. Furthermore, historical data reflect systemic inequalities that could be perpetuated if IA is trained with biased information. It concludes that while AI can improve the efficiency of the criminal justice system, its adoption requires a robust regulatory framework, external audits and the formation of multidisciplinary teams to ensure transparency and fairness.

Of the 7128 initially identified articles, 4 articles of manual search were included but none article of the artificial intelligence website were added. Among the most used: at the intraoral scanners were the TRIOS (3shape) (n=2) and for facial images the Apple Inc. cell phones (n=2). The most frequently reported software was Bellus3D (Bellus3D Inc.) with particular emphasis on the georeferencing tactic software. Several commonalities were observed, including the requirement for a 30cm spacing during cell phone-based extraoral scanning, the necessity for multiple captures, and the inclusion of landmarks and/or perioral and nasal scans.

The general objective is to determine how the integration of AI tools improves academic productivity and optimizes research processes in the educational field. The problem investigated focuses on the need to understand whether AI represents an effective resource to enhance scientific production or whether its implementation faces technological and methodological barriers. The methodology used was a quantitative approach, using a Structural Equation Model (SEM) to analyses the relationship between AI and teaching scientific production. Surveys were applied to 153 teacher-researchers and evaluation tests and factor analysis with WLSMV estimation were carried out, due to the absence of normality in the data. Hypothesis H1 was formulated, which states that the integration of AI has a significant positive impact on teaching scientific production. The results confirmed this hypothesis, showing a high score (\u03b2 = 0.878, p < .001) between the use of AI and research quality. It is concluded that AI optimizes time and rigor in research, although access and training barriers persist, suggesting the need for institutional strategies for its effective implementation.", "urls": ["http://scielo.sld.cu/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S2218-36202025000200003&lang=pt"], "file_attachments1": "http://scielo.sld.cu/pdf/rus/v17n2/2218-3620-rus-17-02-e4994.pdf", "keywords": ["SDGs", "Development Goals", "Scientific production", "AI", "University professor", "ODS", "Objetivos de desarrollo", "Producci\u00f3n cient\u00edfica", "IA", "Docente universitario"]}, {"type_of_reference": "JOUR", "authors": ["Saban, Mart\u00edn"], "title": "Inteligencia artificial generativa en las publicaciones cient\u00edfica", "translated_title": "Generative artificial intelligence in scientific publications", "journal_name": "Argentinian journal of respiratory and physical therapy", "alternate_title1": "Argentinian j. respiratory physical therapy", "issn": "2618-4095", "volume": "7", "number": "1", "doi": "10.58172/ajrpt.v7i1.363", "name_of_database": "SciELO Argentina", "database_provider": "http://www.scielo.org/", "id": "S2618-40952025000100001-arg", "language": "es", "start_page": "1", "end_page": "4", "date": "2025-04", "year": "2025", "urls": ["http://www.scielo.org.ar/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S2618-40952025000100001&lang=pt"], "file_attachments1": "http://www.scielo.org.ar/pdf/ajrpt/v7n1/2618-4095-ajrpt-7-01-1.pdf", "keywords": ["inteligencia artificial", "publicaciones", "manuscritos", "autor\u00eda en la publicaci\u00f3n cient\u00edfica", "sesgo", "discusiones bio\u00e9ticas"]}, {"type_of_reference": "JOUR", "authors": ["Santander Moreno, Jessica Johanna", "D\u00e1vila Castillo, Marcelo Ra\u00fal", "Mart\u00ednez Perenguez, Jostin Sebasti\u00e1n"], "title": "Impacto de la capacitaci\u00f3n en competencias digitales docentes y de la ense\u00f1anza", "translated_title": "Impact of training on teachers&#039; digital competencies and teaching", "journal_name": "Conrado", "alternate_title1": "Conrado", "issn": "1990-8644", "volume": "21", "number": "103", "name_of_database": "SciELO Cuba", "database_provider": "http://www.scielo.org/", "id": "S1990-86442025000200030-cub", "language": "es", "start_page": "", "end_page": "", "date": "2025-04", "year": "2025", "abstract": "ABSTRACT The present study aimed to design and implement a training program to improve teachers' digital competencies, with an emphasis on the use of artificial intelligence as a pedagogical tool. This approach sought to address gaps in technological skills and promote personalized teaching in secondary and higher education institutions in Ecuador. A three-phase methodology was employed: initial assessment, practical training, and final evaluation. During the initial assessment, teachers were found to have low levels of digital competence in several key areas. Teachers participated in a program structured into five practical modules, utilizing problem-based learning and educational simulations. The training incorporated critical reflection through the \"six thinking hats\" technique, which facilitated the application of acquired knowledge to real-world contexts. The final evaluation demonstrated significant improvements across all assessed areas. Notably, the program had a transformative impact, enhancing teachers' digital competencies and promoting the effective use of AI in teaching practices. However, challenges regarding the long-term sustainability of these practices were identified. The study recommended the implementation of complementary strategies to strengthen the integration of AI and digital skills into the educational environment over time.", "urls": ["http://scielo.sld.cu/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1990-86442025000200030&lang=pt"], "file_attachments1": "http://scielo.sld.cu/pdf/rc/v21n103/1990-8644-rc-21-103-e4406.pdf", "keywords": ["Digital competencies", "Artificial intelligence", "Problem-based learning", "Teacher training", "Personalized teaching", "Competencias digitales", "Inteligencia artificial", "Aprendizaje por problemas", "Capacitaci\u00f3n docente", "Ense\u00f1anza personalizada"]}, {"type_of_reference": "JOUR", "authors": ["Durand-Gonz\u00e1lez, Javiera B.", "Gerbaud-Kern, Leonardo"], "title": "Problemas para la puesta en pr\u00e1ctica del r\u00e9gimen de responsabilidad civil en el proyecto de ley de inteligencia artificial (mensaje n.\u00b0 063-371)", "translated_title": "Challenges in the implementation of civil liability under the artificial intelligence bill of law (message no. 063-371)", "journal_name": "Revista chilena de derecho privado", "alternate_title1": "RChDP", "issn": "0718-8072", "volume": "", "number": "44", "doi": "10.32995/s0718-80722025931", "name_of_database": "SciELO Chile", "database_provider": "http://www.scielo.org/", "id": "S0718-80722025000100319-chl", "language": "es", "start_page": "319", "end_page": "336", "date": "2025-04", "year": "2025", "abstract": "Abstract This article analyzes the civil liability regime proposed in Chile\u2019s Artificial Intelligence Bill, submitted to the Chamber of Deputies on May 7, 2024.

Under a qualitative methodology, with a documentary review of 52 articles from the Scopus, ScienceDirect, EBSCOhost, Scielo and Redalyc databases and with the PRISMA method. The main results indicate that the vast majority of research focuses only on analyzing and mentioning ChatGPT as the main GenAI, followed by Bard AI (Gemini) and Copilot, neglecting the large number of other collaborative tools that help to develop specific tasks. Furthermore, research has assumed that users are familiar with the correct way of writing instructions to be given to GenAIs, called Prompts, and do not indicate in their research the process of how to do it, causing many users to obtain incorrect results or to be dissatisfied with the results obtained and, in the worst case, to consider the results valid when they are not correct due to the GIGO effect. Finally, users use GenAIs mostly to search, synthesize, summarize, paraphrase, write new or existing information, generate audio, graphics, images, videos, music, three-dimensional images, detect anti-plagiarism and originality of documents, and translate texts into any language.
